# Flipkart Products: Exploratory Data Analysis & Visualization

## Overview
Flipkart Pvt Ltd. is a leading Indian e-commerce company headquartered in Bengaluru, India. Established in 2007 by Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal, Flipkart initially focused on book sales before expanding into multiple categories such as consumer electronics, fashion, and lifestyle products.

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Visualization** on Flipkart product data to identify patterns, trends, and insights related to sales, discounts, and product categories.

## Techniques Used
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Data Visualization**

## Built With
- **Jupyter Notebook**

## Dataset
- Flipkart Products Data

## Objectives
The primary goal of this analysis is to explore and extract insights from Flipkart's product sales data by answering key questions:
- What does the dataset structure look like?
- What are the key data patterns?
- How should missing values be handled?
- How can data be prepared for analysis?
- What are the monthly sales trends?
- How do discounts vary across different product categories?
- Which product categories have the highest sales?

## Jupyter Notebook Index
1. **Data Loading & Exploration**
2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
3. **Missing Values Handling**
4. **Sales & Discounts Analysis**
5. **Category-Wise Performance Insights**
6. **Visualizations & Insights**

## Libraries Used
- **NumPy** - For numerical operations
- **Pandas** - For data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib** - For data visualization
- **Seaborn** - For statistical visualizations

## Key Insights & Findings
- The dataset is **sufficiently complete**, with minimal missing values.
- Sales distribution follows **seasonal trends** over the years and months.
- **December 2015 & January 2016** recorded the highest product sales, indicating peak shopping periods.
- Sales in **2015 were higher** compared to 2016 based on the available data.
- **Automotive, Mobiles & Accessories, and Clothing** categories received the highest discounts.
- The most sold product categories were **Clothing, Jewelry, and Footwear**.
